# The Suffix "ish"

## Adjective with ish

`brownish` stands for colors similar to brown, `reddish` stands for colors similar to red, so does `yellowish`, `bluish`, `greenish`, `purplish` or any other colors.

`roundish` stands for shapes similar to round, `squarish` stands for shapes similar to square, etc.

So an adjective with a *ish* as suffix means that something is similar to the original adjective.


## Noun with ish

Noun with the *ish* as suffix is different. For example, `foolish` means someone or something looks like fool, it doesn't have the *similar* meaning. Waterish means something contains water, nothing about *similar*, either.

It seems that a noun with a *ish* as suffix just mean something is related to the noun.


## But

All those are just my guess, I can't ensure the accuracy. There might be some exceptions, I will change this blog when I know that.
