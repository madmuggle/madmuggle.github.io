## The Missing Concept

I was reading quora for fun just now, and I found something interesting [here][quorapage]. It's not about the theme of that question, but the concepts brought out by one of the answers.

Some of you may not be able to access quora, I don't know why, but I failed helping other people to register a quora account yesterday because of the network problem.

So I made a screenshot on that answer.

I suddenly realize that I had no concepts on *poisonous* and *venomous* before. If you asked me on that theme yesterday, I probably would tell you that "*red mushrooms are poisonous*" and "*snakes are poisonous*".

But they are really different concepts, *poisonous* means you will die if you bite it, while *venomous* means you will die if you are bitten by it.


## Why?

Why didn't I realize the difference before? Well, in my mother language, "*snakes are venomous*" means "蛇有毒", and "*red mushrooms are poisonous*" means "红蘑菇有毒".

So that's the reason: venomous and poisonous are represented by the same word in Chinese.

Again, why is that? Maybe my ancestors thought it's not so important to distinguish these 2 concepts. Anyway, if something was described by anyone of the two, you just need to stay away from it.
