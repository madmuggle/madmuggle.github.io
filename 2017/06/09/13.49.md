# Go Language Skill: unsafe.Pointer & uintptr

## Better Examples

I wrote [a blog][prevblog] about the `unsafe.Pointer` and `uintptr` of Go programming language before. But I feel that article is not clear enough, the examples could be better.

So I decide to write some better examples. (By better I mean simpler and clearer)


## Type Cast

You can do typecast directly in C language. For example, if you want to treat a variable `x` of TypeA as TypeB, you just need to do:

```c
(*TypeB)&x
```

In Go language, you need to use `unsafe.Pointer` as a bridge:

```go
(*TypeB)(unsafe.Pointer(&x))
```


## Pointer Calculation

You can do pointer calculation directly in C language. For example, `x` is the address of the first element of an array. you can get the address of the second element by doing this:

```c
x + 1
```

In Go language, you need to use `uintptr`:

```go
uintptr(x) + 1
```

Caution, the argument `x` of `uintptr` have to be an `unsafe.Pointer`. You can't calculate normal pointers.
