# A Interesting Fact About Spiders: Leg & Muscle
2017/06/02 19:59:00


I found an interesting question in quora: [Why do a spider's legs curl up when it dies?][quora]. The answer got me shocked. I never knew that the muscles on spider's legs can only do "curl". Spiders don't have muscles for extending legs. It's the liquid pressure that make spider's leg extend.

I thought that all movements of animals are driven by muscles. There may be some exceptions, but I never expect that this situation would exist on big animals like spider.
