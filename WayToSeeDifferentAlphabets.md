# A Good Way To See Different Alphabets

## Ubuntu Alphabet Test

Ubuntu desktop have a file that contains a list of different alphabet sets, so you can know what kind of languages the system supports. If you want to know how arabic or some other alphabet looks like, it is the perfect place to go.

But if you are not using Ubuntu, how can you find samples for various alphabets?

Google is one of the solutions of course. For example, if you want to see arabic alphabets, you can simply find an arabic website. And to find an arabic website, just google "arabic website", it will lead you to some sites like <http://www.bbc.com/arabic>.

But using google for this is not the best way, it's inconvenient, and the site you found may be unaccessible because of network problem like GFW.

What you really need is wikipedia.


## Wikipedia

Let's see a wikipedia page first: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serval>. This is the English version, but on the left side of that page, you can see a list of different languages. Clicking the language name will lead you to the wiki page of that language.

For example, clicking "עברית" will lead you to the [Hebrew version](https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A1%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%95%D7%90%D7%9C). Clicking "العربية" will lead you to the [Arabic version](https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%A8%D8%AC). Clicking "Русский" will lead you to the [Russian version](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A1%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BB).

By the way, I really like serval, that's why I choose that page.

According to [this site][servalspeed], serval's top speed is 80km/h, which is pretty fast. In fact, serval is the NO.2 speedster in felidae, only slower than cheetah.
