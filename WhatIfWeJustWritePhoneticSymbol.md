# What If We Just Write Phonetic Symbol ?

## The Incompetent Phonogram

English is a kind of [phonogram][phonogramwiki], which means the words you wrote stand for the pronunciation, then the pronunciation stands for the meaning. In fact, most languages in the world are phonogram.

By comparison, Chinese is a kind of [ideogram][ideogramwiki], the words you wrote stand for the meaning directly, you need to learning the pronunciation separately. That's one of the reasons why it takes so long for people to learn Chinese.

But English is an incompetent phonogram, because you can't read English words directly. This is annoying, especially with the comparison of other phonograms like Spanish or Italian.

That why we need phonetic symbols. Only with the help phonetic symbols will you be able to know that it should be pronounced as /fə'netɪk/, not /'fonetɪk/, nor /fə'nɪtɪk/.


## Write Phonetic Symbols Directly ?

So, what if we write the phonetic symbols directly? If the phonetic symbols can represent all pronunciations, it can stands for English directly without the help of the in-using English.

I never find the answer.

Maybe phonetic symbols are too long. Usually, phonetic symbols take more writing space than normal words.

Maybe it's not good to have so many alphabet symbols. Besides the normal latin alphabets, phonetic symbols contain alphabets like "æ", "ð", "ʒ" ...

But I have never been persuaded by those reasons.


## The Old English

Lately, I found that English is totally different in the ancient ages. The Old English is a good phonogram, you can read it without the help of phonetic symbols!

And surprisingly, I found it uses something like today's phonetic symbol directly:

> Þa cwæð se gingra to his fæder, "Fæder, sele me mine dæl minre æhte þe me to gebyreþ." Þa dælde he him his æhta. 

I don't know what that sentence means, it's copied from [this site][ancientenglish].

This is the answer I've been looking for. Of course we can use phonetic symbols directly, that's what the Old English does.

People finally chose a simpler alphabet system, that's all.


## Edit 2017/06/01

I found more information about Ancient English alphabets in [this quora page][quora]. Here are the abandoned alphabets and their modern replacements.

- eth - ð - mostly replaced by th
- thorn - þ - mostly replaced by th
- ash- æ -mostly replaced by a or e
- yogh - ȝ - mostly replaced by gh, or z sometimes
- wynn - ƿ - mostly replaced by w
