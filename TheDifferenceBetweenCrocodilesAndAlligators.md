Crocodile, the reptile with long jaw who is powerful and beautiful, is probably the favorite animal for many boys. Sometimes you can see a picture of a crocodile with the word *alligator*. Does crocodile have more than one name? Is that the *latin name* or something for crocodile?

The answer is no. Crocodile and alligator are two different animals. I found a perfect answer from [this site][crocodilianbiologydatabase].

The key point is the shape of the jaw. Alligators have a wide "U"-shaped snout like a shovel, whereas crocodiles have longer and more pointed "V"-shaped snout. As a result of that, alligators have wider upper jaw, which overlaps the lower jaw completely. So you can only see the teeth in the upper jaw when alligator's mouth closes.

Besides that, I feel alligators are usually smaller than crocodiles. And alligators seem to have bigger frog-like eyes. So smaller but more beautiful, that's my impression on alligators.
