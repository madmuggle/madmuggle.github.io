# Lexical Binding And `let`, `letrec`(`labels`)


When I was reading picolisp's document, I found some interesting opinion on dynamic scoping. And in [this page][1], it saids `labels` was introduced because of the problem of lexical binding:

>  Therefore, most Lisps with lexical binding introduce "special variables" to support dynamic binding as well, and constructs like labels to extend the scope of variables beyond a single function.

Don't dynamic binding need `labels`?

I write a sample code like this:

```lisp
(let ((v1 (lambda () 1))
      (v2 (lambda () (funcall v1))))
  (funcall v2))
```

Then I test it in Clozure CL, I got an error:
```
Unbound variable: V1
   [Condition of type UNBOUND-VARIABLE]
```

But when I test it in Emacs Lisp(who is dynamic binding by default), and get result:
```
1 (#o1, #x1, ?\C-a)
```

It works !

So it's right, Lisp with dynamic binding do NOT need `labels` or `letrec`.
