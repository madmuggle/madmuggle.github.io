# The `labels` and `letrec`


## Comparison between CL and Scheme

In Common Lisp, `flet` is some kind of syntax sugar for `let`, but `labels` is not syntax sugar for `let*`. There is no special operator for function that works like `let*`. `label` is something like Scheme's `letrec`.

The difference of `let*` and `letrec` can be shown by this example:
```scheme
(let ((a (lambda () 4)))
  (letrec ((b (lambda () (+ 1 (a))))
           (a (lambda () 10)))
    (b)))
;;=> 11

(let ((a (lambda () 4)))
  (let* ((b (lambda () (+ 1 (a))))
         (a (lambda () 10)))
    (b)))
;;=> 5
```

For Common Lisp, there is a similar example:

```lisp
(flet ((a () 4))
  (labels ((b () (+ 1 (a)))
	   (a () 10))
    (b)))
;;=> 11
```

Here is the relationship between Common lisp and Scheme:

| Bind Type    | Common Lisp | Scheme |
| -----------: | :---------- | :----- |
| non-function | let         | let    |
| non-function | let*        | let*   |
| non-function |             | letrec |
|     function | flet        | let    |
|     function |             | let*   |
|     function | labels      | letrec |



## How does it works ?

The R5RS have explained how `letrec` is transformed into more fundamental constructs like `let`. Here is an example to make it even clearer:

```scheme
(letrec ((r1 v1) (r2 v2)) body)
```

Will be transformed into something like:

```scheme
(let ((r1 <undefined>) (r2 <undefined>)) ; scheme implementations have different ways to represent <undefined>
  (let ((t1 v1) (t2 v2))
    (set! r1 t1)
    (set! r2 t2))
  body)
```

Similarly, `let*` works in this way:

```scheme
(let* ((r1 v1) (r2 v2)) body)
```

Will be transformed into something like:

```scheme
(let ((r1 v1))
  (let ((r2 v2))
    body))
```

One more step, `let` itself can also be transformed in to more fundamental constructs like `lambda`. For example:

```scheme
(let ((r1 v1) (r2 v2)) body)
```

Will be transformed into something like:

```scheme
((lambda (r1 r2) body) v1 v2)
```

Of course the certain compiler may choose to transform them into other kinds of forms for better performance. But the semantic meaning won't change.
