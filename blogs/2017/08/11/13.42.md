# Why is it called "emoji" instead of "emozi" ?

The word "emoji" is from the Japanese word "えもじ", and Japanese also write it as "emozi". But Japanese pronounce "zi" as "ji", so it's ok to write it as "emoji".

But there is a strange thing. Japanese pronounce "r" as "l", and the word "Naruto" is actually pronounced as "Naluto". But all people use the word "Naruto". Why don't we care about the pronunciation this time?

I think it would be better to use the word "emozi" instead of "emoji".
