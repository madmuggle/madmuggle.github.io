# Use CSS Selectors For Animations Across Different Elements


CSS supports some events like `focus`, `hover`, `active` and so on. It is very convenient when you need some simple animations, but you can only control a single element alone. For example, you can make ELEMENT1 to become red when mouse pointer hover on it, but you can not make the element besides ELEMENT1 change.

That's what I thought before. And I was wrong.

The CSS selector support some special syntax with symbols like `+`, `>`. And with them you can change ELEMENT2 when ELEMENT1 received events in some cases.

Here is an example. Move your mouse pointer around the squares below, you will see the effect.
<style>
.p {
  width: 250px;
  height: 20px;
  border: 1px solid grey;
  text-align: center
}
.a, .b {
  width: 100px;
  height: 10px;
  background-color: blue;
  display: inline-block;
}
.p:hover > .b {
  background-color: green;
}
.a:hover + .b {
  background-color: red;
}
</style>

<div class="p">
<span class="a"></span> <span class="b"></span>
</div>


The CSS setting for the example above:
```css
.p {
  width: 250px;
  height: 20px;
  border: 1px solid grey;
  text-align: center
}
.a, .b {
  width: 100px;
  height: 10px;
  background-color: blue;
  display: inline-block;
}
.p:hover > .b {
  background-color: green;
}
.a:hover + .b {
  background-color: red;
}
```

The related HTML is pretty simple, just two normal span element:
```html
<div class="p">
<span class="a"></span> <span class="b"></span>
</div>
```
