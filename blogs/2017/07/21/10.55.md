# The Relationship Between Command "su" And "sudo"
2017/07/21 10:55:00

The unix command "su" and "sudo" can do similar things. For a long time, I thought they are different commands from the same software package. But they are not.

With Debian or distributions based on Debian, you can use "dpkg" command to find which package the command come from. For example, to find which package "su" belongs to, just run this:

```sh
$ dpkg -S /bin/su
login: /bin/su
```

The same way, we can find which package "sudo" belongs to:

```sh
$ dpkg -S /usr/bin/sudo
sudo: /usr/bin/sudo
```

As you can see, they really comes from different packages. The command "su" is part of the "login" package, while "sudo" is part of the "sudo" package.

We can use "dpkg" to list all commands of a package, too. For "login" package:

```sh
$ dpkg -L login | grep bin
/bin
/bin/login
/bin/su
/usr/bin
/usr/bin/faillog
/usr/bin/lastlog
/usr/bin/newgrp
/usr/sbin
/usr/sbin/nologin
/usr/bin/sg
```

And for "sudo" package:

```sh
$ dpkg -L sudo | grep bin
/usr/bin
/usr/bin/sudo
/usr/bin/sudoreplay
/usr/sbin
/usr/sbin/visudo
/usr/bin/sudoedit
```

So, "su" may looks like "sudo", but they are from different families. And although "login" and "su" looks so different, they are real brothers.
