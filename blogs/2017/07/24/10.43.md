# The Command "find" with specified depth


The unix command "find" is pretty powerful, I knew it can do search with time, type and name patterns, but today I find it can also do search on certain directory depth.

For example, assume that the directory structure of current path is like this:
```
.
├── a
│   ├── b
│   │   ├── c
│   │   └── c.js
│   └── b.js
└── a.js
```

You can use the "mindepth" and "maxdepth" options to specify the directories you want to search. The option name is self-explained, but I still think some examples would be helpful.

```
$ find . -mindepth 1 -name '*.js' | sort
./a/b/c.js
./a/b.js
./a.js
```

```
$ find . -mindepth 2 -name '*.js' | sort
./a/b/c.js
./a/b.js
```

```
$ find . -mindepth 3 -name '*.js' | sort
./a/b/c.js
```

```
$ find . -maxdepth 1 -name '*.js' | sort
./a.js
```

```
$ find . -maxdepth 2 -name '*.js' | sort
./a/b.js
./a.js
```

```
$ find . -maxdepth 3 -name '*.js' | sort
./a/b/c.js
./a/b.js
./a.js
```
