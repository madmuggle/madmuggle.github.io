# Generating Markdown Blogs Without My Scripts
2017/07/06 22:37:00


I used to compile my markdown blogs to HTML with some Node.js scripts. It worked fine. But recently I just get board about javascript, and I don't want to maintain those code anymore. So I looked for some other solutions.

Writing a new blog generator with some other languages was the first solution that came to me. But I don't want to write that thing, it's boring to write such program for the 2nd time, whatever programing language I use to write it.

Then I realized that Github have already provided the solution. With some configurations, it will compile the markdown automatically!

The only problam is that it won't collect article items and generate an index page for me. That can be solved easily, a little bash script will do the job:


```bash
for f in $(find ./blogs -name '*.md' | sort -r)
do echo "- [$(head -n1 $f | cut -c3-)]($(echo $f | sed 's#.\(/blogs/.*\)\.md$#\1.html#'))"
done > index.md
```

Now it works pretty fine, I don't need to maintain my blog generator, and I can give more time on article or anything else.
