# Use Curl Command To Send multipart/form-data


Sending HTTP multipart/form-data request with curl command is pretty convenient. You just need to use the `-F` option. One `-F` field stands for one part. Content of `-F` option is some kind of key-value pairs. This is an example:

```sh
curl 192.168.1.2:8080 -F 'blah=@/tmp/test.png;type=image/png' -F 'what=todonow'
```

The request being sent is something like this:

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.1.2:8080
User-Agent: curl/7.51.0
...Other http headers...

--------------------------e421a4f4d08a75ea

Content-Disposition: form-data; name="blah"; filename="test.png"
Content-Type: image/png

...THE PNG FILE CONTENT...

--------------------------e421a4f4d08a75ea

Content-Disposition: form-data; name="what"

todonow

```

Inside the request, you can see the key-value pairs you specified in command line option. The string before "=" will be used as the "name" of a part, and the string after "=" will be the body of that part.
