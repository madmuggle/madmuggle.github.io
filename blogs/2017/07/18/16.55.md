# Something about IMO number



[IMO Number][imowiki] is the ID for registered ship. It consists of 7 unique numbers, but today I found that it's only 6 unique numbers, the last one is a check digit.

This is some information about IMO number copied from wikipedia:
> This consists of a six-digit sequential unique number followed by a check digit. ...
For example, for IMO 9074729: (9×7) + (0×6) + (7×5) + (4×4) + (7×3) + (2×2) = 139.
