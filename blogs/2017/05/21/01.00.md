# Semi, Demi, Hemi



## Semicolon & Demigod

The first prefix who stands for "half" that I learned is "semi". Colon stands for ":", so semicolon stands for ";". Pretty easy to understand.

Then I learned the prefix "demi" from movies. "Demigod" is a popular word these years. You can hear it from movies like [The Avengers][theavengers], where Thor was called demigod; Or you can hear it from Disney animation like [Moana][moana], where Maui was called demigod, too.


## Why?

Why there are so many prefixes that stand for the same thing? I just find a good explanation from [here][answer].

> "semi-" is from the Latin for "half", "hemi-" is from the Greek for "half", "demi-" is from the French for "half".

Historical thing again.
