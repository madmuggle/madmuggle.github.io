## The Past Monthes

I have beening writing blogs since about 8 monthes ago, and it has become part of my spare time. I used to think a lot before writing anything, but once you do it frequently, it becomes really tiring. Especially when you've been working hard for a whole day.
 
Then I decide, I will stop writing blogs, or I will just write whatever that comes to my mind, no matter how poor my words are. The later one looks more positive, so I chose it.

That's a right decision.

Once I stop pushing myself on good sentence, it becomes interesting to write blog. I can even write only 3 lines if I want. That what personal blog should be like!


## Practise Foreign Language

I've been writing in Chinese for the past monthes. It's good, but it can be better. Why don't I write blogs in foreign languages?

You need to use the language if you want to learn it better. It will be a big waste if I write blogs in my mother language when I can write it in foreign language.

So this is my decision: *I will write all my following blogs in foreign languages*.

Should be fun ;-)
