# The Direction Of Writting



## Ordinary: Left to Right

Writing from left to right is the commonly used way. Most languages follow this rule. Including English(and most Europe languages), Sanskrit, modern Chinese, Japanese, etc.

But that is not the only way for writing.


## Right to Left

Arabic and languages based on Arabic alphabet like Farsi are written from right to left, then top to bottom. Hebrew is written from right to left, too.

I have been wondering how could Arabic children keep their hands clean when writting with a pencil. Chinese is written from left to right, but I still get my hands dirty after some writting when I was a child.

Maybe they haven't solved this problem yet. Or maybe they just don't write with pencil.


## Top to Bottom

Mongolian and Manchu Language are written from top to bottom, then right to left. So does ancient Chinese.

Mongolian and Manchu use Uighur script, which is an alphabet set created by Uigurs, while Uigurs use Arabic alphabet themselves. Isn't it interesting?


## Sum up

So there are some simple skills to distinguish the writing direction of languages:

- Languages based on Latin alphabet, Cyrillic alphabet or Sanskrit alphabet are written from left to right.
- Languages based on Arabic alphabet are written from right to left.
- Languages based on Uighur script are written from top to bottom.

As most writing systems are phonogram, and those are the most commonly used alphabet sets, this skill can be very useful.
