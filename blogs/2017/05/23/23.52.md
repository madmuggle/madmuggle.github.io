## The Common Part

Today I learned a long words "compartmentalize". I have a poor memory, so I tried to find out how this word is constructed. And I find a familiar thing: *-partment*.

It's interesting that all words who contains the "partment" have something in common. Words like "a-partment", "de-partment", "com-partment", they have different but related meanings.

The following explanations were copied from the *Dictionary Application* in Mac OS:

*Apartment* is a suite of rooms forming one residence, typically in a building containing a number of these.

*Department* a division of a large organization such as a government, university, business, or shop, dealing with a specific subject, commodity, or area of activity.

*Compartment* a separate section of a structure or container in which certain items can be kept separate from others.

So what's the rule of them?


## "part" & "ment"

As you can see, those words are all "boxes" who have separated parts. So we can look it as concatenating "part" and "ment" to form a noun to represent such thing. Just like concatenating "move" and "ment" to form a noun to stand for the act of changing physical location or position.

So it's easy to remember "compartment" now. Then you can add the "-lize" tail, which stands for making something true, to stand for separating something.

Now I won't forget this word.
