# A New Redis Client For Node.js


Weeks ago, I wrote my own redis client package for Node.js. It's ES6+ based, so the code is clean, small and readable. I hope that more people will use it and make it better.

I named it `newredis`, because there is already a npm package named `redis`. You can find it in [github][4] or [npm][5].


## Why another ?

There are already some redis client available now, but some of them doesn't contains connection pool implementation, and those who implemented connection pool usually based on [node\_redis][1].

`node_redis` is a good package, but there are 2 things about node\_redis that I can't get used to. (The following tests are based on node\_redis@2.8.0)

1. The callback do not get error when the connection is down. You can try the following script:

```javascript
const redis = require("redis");
const conn = redis.createClient(6379, "localhost");
conn.on("error", e => console.error("***Conn err:", e));

setInterval(() => {
  console.log("==Sending command request...");
  conn.get("test_string", (e, r) => {
    if (e) console.error("**command get error:", e);
    else console.log("result:", r);
  });
}, 1000);
```

Start that script, you will see outputs like this:

```
==Sending command request...
result: hello
==Sending command request...
result: hello
...
```

Then you shutdown the redis server, this is what you will see:

```
==Sending command request...
***Conn err: { Error: Redis connection to localhost:6379 failed - connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:6379
==Sending command request...
***Conn err: { Error: Redis connection to localhost:6379 failed - connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:6379
...
```

You will never see string like "\*\*command get error" because the callback of `conn.get` has never been not called.

This is odd, and it's also why you can't make a perfect Promise wrapper for node\_redis.

In my opinion, if the connection got error when `conn.get` is called, it should trigger the callback of `conn.get`, and give err as argument to the callback of `conn.get`. And I made newredis-node works in that way.



2. node\_redis wraps every redis command. I don't think it's right. Writing `conn.execute([ "get", "blah" ])` is more flexible then writing `conn.get("blah")`. The previous one is easier to integrate with other programs.

For more complex method like `hmset`, writing `conn.hmset(key, { a: 1, b: 2 })` is cool, but you can also solve it by writing a simple helper function like this:

```javascript
function tohmset(key, obj) {
  return [ "hmset", key ].concat([].concat(...Object.entries(obj)));
}
```

then `conn.execute(tohmset(key, { a: 1, b: 2 }))`. Convenient, too. And you don't need to remember those rules for a certain library.

If you think the wrapper is important, you should do it in upper level, like what [dbexecutors][3] does.


That's why I implement another redis client.
