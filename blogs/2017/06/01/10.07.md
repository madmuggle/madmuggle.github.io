# The Latinized Chinese: Latinxua Sin Wenz



The [Pinyin][wikipinyin] is the official romanization system for Chinese, but it is not the only one. Besides Pinyin, there are at least 2 similar systems: [Gwoyeu Romatzyh][wikigwoyeuromatzyh] and [Latinxua Sin Wenz][wikilatinxuasinwenz].

The *Latinxua Sin Wenz* is the most interesting one, because it's more than just usable, it had been used in over 300 publications once. And it is much simpler than *Pinyin* and *Gwoyeu Romatzyh* as it was usually written without tones.
