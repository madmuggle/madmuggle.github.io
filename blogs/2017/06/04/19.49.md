# The Amazons And The Amazon River



Years ago, the first time I know *Wonder Woman* of DC comics, I was confused by the fact that Diana is an amazon warrior. Does Diana live in South America? I didn't know the connection between Diana and that river in South America, nor did I have the interest to dig out.

Today I watched the movie *Wonder Woman* starring Gal Gadot, it's much better than I have expected. In fact, I think it's much more interesting than Marvel's *Thor*. And I decide to find out why Diana and her family are called Amazon.

As a Chinese, I am not familiar with history of western countries, I guess that's why I didn't know the Amazons before.

[Amazons][wiki_amazons] were a tribe of women warriors in ancient Greek mythology. And ancient Greek ended more than 2000 years ago, while Amazon River was named less than 500 years ago.

So Diana have nothing related to that river in South America, the river was named based on Amazons of Greek mythology.
