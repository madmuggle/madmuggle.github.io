# Block Style & Indented Style
2017/02/27 17:48:00


小学开始写作文的时候，老师就教我们每一段开头要留两个字的空白。后来初中写英文也顺其自然，没问缘由就沿用了这个习惯。

今天发现原来是存在两种规范的，分别叫“齐头式”(Block style)和“缩进式”(Indented Style)。

两者的区别通过一个小例子就能体现出来。

这是Indented Style:

<pre class="pre-article">
Master Bruce,

    The suit is almost finished, only the communication device does not seem
right. Since Lucius can not be here this month, I hope you will check it
before wearing it out.

    By the way, Miss Kyle had been here this morning, I told her you will
be back tomorrow.


                                         Yours,
                                         Alfred
</pre>

这是Block Style:

<pre class="pre-article">
Master Bruce,

The suit is almost finished, only the communication device does not seem
right. Since Lucius can not be here this month, I hope you will check it
before wearing it out.

By the way, Miss Kyle had been here this morning, I told her you will
be back tomorrow.


Yours,
Alfred

我已经完全习惯了Block Style，所有的博客全是用的这种风格。
