# Command "find" with "xargs" or "-exec" argument


## The `find` with `xargs`

Linux commands are hard to remember, so usually I only remember those "valuable" ones.

For example, the `find` command contains a `-exec` argument, the command syntax for this argument is complex, so usually I use `xargs` instead. It works find, until today.


## Situation

When I tried to remove the 2nd line of all my blogs, I tried to use `find` along with `xargs`, but it didn't work as I expected.

Before really changing the file, I printed the target line:

```sh
find blogs/ -name "*.md" | xargs sed -ne 2p
```

It didn't work. But when I tried the `-exec` argument, it works:

```sh
find blogs/ -name "*.md" -exec sed -ne 2p {} \;
```

What can I say, the world is not so perfect, I still need the `-exec` argument.


The final command is:

```sh
find blogs/ -name "*.md" -exec sed -i -e "2s/.*//" {} \;
```
