# The JSON Stream Server


Days ago, I saw a weird program, who defined a protocol based on TCP, with total length as the first field of communication(good), then type of the request as second field(ok), ... But when it come to the data field, it use JSON!

What?! Why would people use JSON in such kind of binary protocol? Or why would people define those length things when they use JSON!

I argued with one of the creator(I guess), but he insists that this is good, I tried to explain to him that "if you use JSON, you don't need those length bytes". He just don't buy it.

I didn't continue that communication, because I know that if I want to make him understand what I said, I have to show him the code. As I didn't know there are already some JSON-stream parser available, and I didn't think I can easily write one myself, I let him win.

Today when I was having lunch, I did some search, then I find there is a good JSON stream parse called [stream-json][1]. And with this, I can easily prove that I was right. ;)

We can create a TCP server to test it:

```js
const s = require("stream-json/utils/StreamJsonObjects").make();

s.output.on("data", o => console.log(o.index, o.value));
require("net").createServer(sock => sock.pipe(s.input)).listen(8000);
```


Start the script, then use `telnet` to test it:

```
$ telnet localhost 8000
Trying ::1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
{ "a": 1, "b": 2,
  "c": 3}

{ "x": 1,

  "y": 2

}
```

Every time you finished a JSON object, the Node.js script will print it out as soon as you finish the last character and type `Enter`.

This is the output of the script:

```
0 { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }
1 { x: 1, y: 2 }
```
