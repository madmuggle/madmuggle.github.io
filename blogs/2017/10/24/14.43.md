# The JSON Stream Server



```js
const s = require("stream-json/utils/StreamJsonObjects").make();

s.output.on("data", o => console.log(o.index, o.value));
require("net").createServer(sock => sock.pipe(s.input)).listen(8000);
```


Start the script, then use `telnet` to test it:

```
$ telnet localhost 8000
Trying ::1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
{ "a": 1, "b": 2,
  "c": 3}

{ "x": 1,

  "y": 2

}
```

Every time you finished a JSON object, the Node.js script will print it out as soon as you finish the last character and type `Enter`.

This is the output of the script:

```
0 { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }
1 { x: 1, y: 2 }
```
